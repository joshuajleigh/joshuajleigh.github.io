I use computers a lot, being a human in 2018 this isn't surprising.

I have grown fond of of linux and the command line, very fond.

My interface causes my spouce to roll her eyes, and my co-worker to shake their heads.

The first step to a cure is admitting that you have problem.

Luckily I don't have a problem, I have a joyful lifestyle- and I want to spread the joy.

{% highlight bash session %}
$ echo "I am not bashing using a GUI."
I am not bashing using a GUI
{% endhighlight %}

I just love the minimalism and power of text. 

The goal of my blog will be to document what tools I've found that keep me closer to the text but still get through day to day life.

If you also have a ~~problem with~~ *undeniable love* of the terminal and have a cool thing I haven't mentioned please let me know!
